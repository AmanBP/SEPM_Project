```

## To run the program :

Clone the repo from top right  
I recommend to place your own compiled sqlite3.o in the dependencies folder, or you could use mine. Ignore if you use c++ from [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) compiler.  
Just run /Builder/Creator.bat  
If " ERROR: The process "a.exe" not found. ", no problem has occured, the script attempts to kill a.exe before deleting it.
